title: Metacatalog GeoCube aggregator
message: >-
  This tool is designed to be used together with the V-FOR-WaTer Metacatalog data loader.
  It uses a number of data source files along with either a metacatalog entry or JSON dumps
  of the metadata.
  The data is aggregated to a target precision (temporal) and spatial resolution and then
  ingested into a geocube that is stored as a netCDF file.
